# BTW Peaceful Mod for b1.7.3

This is an addon for BTW 2.94 for Beta 1.7.3.

- Slime balls from glue and cactus green in the cauldron
- Gunpowder from hellfire dust and sugar (4 each) in a cauldron
- Bone meal from raw porkchops in the millstone
- Bones from fossils that spawn in the world
- This version of BTW already has string from hemp fibers

## Installation

This is a JAR mod that goes below BTW, because I had to override a file. This will not be compatible with other addons that want to add millstone recipes.
